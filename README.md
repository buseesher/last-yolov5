# YOLOv5 Custom Training Pipeline

This script provides a comprehensive pipeline for training and evaluating YOLOv5 object detection models using both public datasets (like COCO) and custom datasets (via Roboflow or Kaggle).

## Features

- Clone and set up YOLOv5 environment
- Perform detection and validation using pretrained weights
- Train on COCO, VOC, and custom datasets
- Integrate with Roboflow for dataset management
- Evaluate model performance and visualize predictions
- Handle multiple project scenarios within a single script

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- Roboflow
- OpenCV, Matplotlib, NumPy
- Kaggle CLI (for dataset downloads)

## Usage

Modify dataset paths and parameters according to your environment or dataset source. Run each section of the script sequentially in a Jupyter notebook or Google Colab for best results.

## Notes

Make sure to add your own Roboflow API key and adjust the dataset/project version accordingly.
